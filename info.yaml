  description: "A Mealy machine that detects the sequence 1010. Output goes high when sequence is detected."

  how_it_works: |
    This is a Mealy machine implementation with 5 states (a, b, c, d, e):
    - State a: Initial state
    - State b: After detecting first '1'
    - State c: After detecting '10'
    - State d: After detecting '101'
    - State e: After detecting '1010' (output = 1)
    
    The output depends on both current state and input.

  how_to_test: |
    1. Reset the design
    2. Apply input sequence on ui[0]
    3. Observe output on uo[0]
    4. Output should go high when sequence 1010 is detected

  external_hw: "No external hardware required. Just connect input and observe output."
